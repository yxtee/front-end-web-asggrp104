      <strong>Let's Learn About the History of the Malays in Malaysia.</strong>
    </h2>
    <br>
    <div>
      <p>
        <strong>Malaysian Malays (Malay: Orang Melayu Malaysia, Jawi: ملايو مليسيا)</strong> are Malaysians of Malay
        ethnicity
        whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in the Malay world. According to the 2023 population estimate, with
        a total population of 17.6 million, Malaysian Malays form 57.9% of Malaysia's demographics, the largest ethnic
        group in the country. They can be broadly classified into two main categories; Anak Jati (indigenous Malays or
        local Malays) and Anak Dagang (trading Malays or foreign Malays).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Anak Jati or native Malays consist of those individuals who adhere to the Malay culture native to the
        coastal areas of Malay Peninsula and Borneo.[3] Among notable groups include the Bruneians, Kedahans,
        Kelantanese, Pahangite, Perakians, Sarawakians and Terengganuans. On the other hand, the Anak Dagang or foreign
        Malays, consist of descendants of immigrants from other parts of Malay Archipelago who became the citizens of
        the Malay sultanates and were absorbed and assimilated into Malay culture at different times, aided by
        similarity in lifestyle and common religion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foreign Malays have Acehnese, Banjarese, Buginese, Javanese, Mandailing and Minangkabau ancestries that come
        from Indonesia.[4][5] Some foreign Malays may also come from other parts of Southeast Asia, that includes the
        Chams of Indochina, Cocos Malays of Australian Cocos (Keeling) Islands as well as the Patani Malays of southern
        Thailand. There is also a minority of Malays who are partially descended from more recent immigrants from many
        other countries who have assimilated into Malay Muslim culture.

      <summary class="h6"><b>Religions</b></summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Islam plays a pivotal role in the lives of Malaysian Malays. The majority of Malays are Sunni Muslims, and
          Islam is not only a religion but also a significant element of their cultural identity. The arrival of Islam
          in the 15th century profoundly transformed Malay society. The Sultanate of Malacca was instrumental in
          spreading Islam across the Malay Peninsula, which became a dominant force shaping the social and cultural
          landscape of the Malays.
        </li>
        <li>
          Islamic practices and principles influence various aspects of daily life for Malaysian Malays. Religious
          observances such as daily prayers, fasting during Ramadan, and the performance of Hajj are integral to their
          spiritual lives. Islamic law (Sharia) is also incorporated into the legal system in Malaysia, particularly in
          matters of personal status such as marriage, inheritance, and family law.
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition to religious practices, Islamic education plays a crucial role. Many Malays attend religious
          schools (Sekolah Agama) alongside secular schools, where they learn about Islamic teachings, Quranic studies,
          and Arabic language. This dual approach to education helps preserve and promote Islamic values within the
          community while also equipping individuals with the skills needed for broader societal participation.

      <summary class="h6"><b>Education</b></summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Education is highly valued among Malaysian Malays, with a strong emphasis on both academic achievement and
          Islamic learning. The Malaysian education system comprises public and private institutions that offer a range
          of educational opportunities from primary to tertiary levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Malaysian Malays typically attend public schools where the curriculum is based on the national education
          system. These schools offer instruction in various subjects, including mathematics, science, languages, and
          social studies, following a syllabus set by the Ministry of Education. Many Malays also attend religious
          schools to receive Islamic education, where they study Islamic history, jurisprudence, and the Quran.
        </li>
        <li>
          For higher education, Malaysian Malays have access to universities and colleges across Malaysia and abroad.
          Public universities, such as Universiti Malaya and Universiti Putra Malaysia, offer a wide range of
          undergraduate and postgraduate programs. Additionally, there are institutions specializing in Islamic studies,
          such as the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), which cater to those seeking advanced religious
          education.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Malaysian government implements various policies to ensure educational access and equity among different
          ethnic groups. Programs like the Bumiputera policy provide opportunities and support for Malays and other
          indigenous groups to advance in education and employment. This policy aims to address socio-economic
          disparities and promote balanced development within the country.
