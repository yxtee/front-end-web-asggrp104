            in Malaysia.</div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Chinese Malaysians (Simplified Chinese: 马来西亚华人; Traditional Chinese: 馬來西亞華人; Malay: Orang Cina
              Malaysia, Jawi: اورڠ چينا مليسيا)</strong>, also commonly called locally as Malaysian Chinese, are
            Malaysian citizens of Han Chinese ethnicity. They form the second-largest ethnic group, after the Malay
            majority, and are 22.8% of the Malaysian population. Most of them are descendants of Southern Chinese
            immigrants who arrived in Malaysia between the early 19th and the mid-20th centuries. Malaysian Chinese form
            the second largest community of Overseas Chinese in the world, after Thai Chinese. Malaysian Chinese are
            traditionally dominant in the business sector of the Malaysian economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most Malaysian Chinese have maintained their Chinese heritage, including their diverse mother tongues.
            However, the descendants of the earliest Chinese migrants who arrived between the 13th and the 17th
            centuries have assimilated aspects of the indigenous Malay cultures and formed distinct sub-ethnic groups,
            such as the Peranakans in Kelantan and Terengganu, Baba-Nyonya in Malacca and Penang, and the Sino-Natives
            in Sabah. The Malaysian Chinese are usually referred to as simply "Chinese" in Malaysian English, "Orang
            Cina" in Malay, "Sina" or "Kina" among indigenous groups in Borneo, "Cīṉar" (சீனர்) in Tamil, and "Huaren"
            (華人/华人, Chinese people), "Huaqiao" (華僑/华侨, Overseas Chinese), or "Huayi" (華裔/华裔, ethnic Chinese) in Mandarin
            by the local Chinese themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Chinese came to Malaysia, they brought their dance, music, and literature with them. However, due
            to Malaysia's multiracial society, most ethnic groups in Malaysia, including the Chinese, have adopted or
            assimilated each other's culture. Today, the Malaysian Chinese do not only speak the Chinese language, eat
            Chinese food, wear Chinese clothes, and appreciate Chinese classical songs, but they also eat Malay and
            Indian food, wear clothes from other cultures, and enjoying the music of other communities. Nonetheless, the
            Malaysian Chinese still keep alot of their traditional celebrations, which forms a large part of the Chinese
            cultural heritage in Malaysia. These celebrations include the Lantern festival, the Dragon Boat festival,
            the Tomb festival, the Hungry Ghost festival, and the Moon Cake festival. Chinese traditional music and
            dance are usually aired and performed during festivities such as the Chinese New Year or when there is a
            funeral. One of their most popular dances is the Lion Dance, which is usually performed during the Chinese
            New Year's celebration. Literature such as The Eight Immortals, The Monkey God, and Na Cha the Dragon Slayer
            are ancient children's stories which are as popular in Malaysia as Mickey Mouse is in the United States.

          <li>
            Based on the 2000 Malaysian Census, 86.6% of ethnic Chinese Malaysians adhere to Buddhism and Chinese folk
            religion with numerous Chinese temples and shrines visible nationwide. More detailed statistics in 2010
            found a total of 5,341,687 ethnic Chinese Malaysians adhere to Buddhism, 706,479 are Christians, 218,261
            practising Confucianism, Taoism and other Chinese folk religious sects, 49,320 were irreligious, 42,048 are
            Muslims, 14,878 are Hindus, 11,387 with unknown religion while 8,576 practising other different religion.

          <li>
            Commonly found in ethnic Chinese homes and shops are altars installed for deities of their affinities
            together with ancestral worship. Most of the deities are of Chinese origin but it is still common to see a
            few local deities. Most, if not all cities in Malaysia include the presence of Chinese Buddhist temples and
            societies. However, there exists towns with only Buddhist statues, although some may have one or two other
            Chinese deities.

        <ul>
          <li>
            In educational aspects, Malaysia is the only country outside China and Taiwan with a comprehensive and
            complete Chinese education system and the only Southeast Asian country that has perpetuated the Chinese
            education system established since the colonial era as a result of heavy brokerage and lobbying efforts by
            ethnic Chinese Malaysians political leaders with continual funding from local Chinese communities. The first
            Chinese schools had been established in the country in the 19th century during the British colonial
            administration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since late 1970, ethnic Chinese Malaysians had expanded their own Mandarin-language primary schools where
            around 90% of their children were enrolled based on the figures from 2006. These schools gained a reputation
            for not only maintaining good discipline but also providing the high-quality education that the Malay
            schools were seen by some to lack.
          </li>
          <li>
            Currently, there are two broad categories for Chinese schools here: those that are private and those that
            are government-aided (SJKC and SMJK).
            <ul>
              <li>
                <u>Chinese independant high schools</u> <br>

                These schools do not receive funding from the federal government, except for one-off contributions.The
                respective school boards continue to rely on school fees and donations from the community for all
                expenses including teachers’ salaries and infrastructure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>SJKC and SMJK: Government-aided schools</u><br>

                There are also primary schools where Mandarin is used to teach all subjects. These existed before
                Malaysia was formed in 1963 and are now known as SJKC. SK schools are located on public land and
                accorded the status of “government schools” which the ministry fully maintains and funds. Similarly for
                SMJK schools which were once Chinese-medium schools that opted to conform by using BM and the national
                syllabus in return for government aid, the amount of government funding received also depends on
                ownership of school land.
