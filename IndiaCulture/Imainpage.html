            <p>
                <strong>Malaysian Indians (Malay: Orang India Malaysia, Jawi: اورڠ ايدان مليسيا)</strong>
                are Malaysian citizens of Indian ethnicity. They constitute a significant ethnic group in Malaysia,
                making up approximately 7% of the Malaysian population. The majority of Malaysian Indians are
                descendants of South Indian immigrants who arrived in Malaysia during the British colonial period, from
                the late 19th to the early 20th centuries. This migration was largely driven by labor demands in the
                rubber plantations, railways, and civil service. Malaysian Indians are traditionally influential in
                various sectors including business, education, and the arts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many Malaysian Indians have preserved their Indian heritage through their diverse languages, religions,
                and cultural practices. While Tamil is the most commonly spoken language among Malaysian Indians, other
                languages such as Telugu, Malayalam, and Punjabi are also represented. The community is predominantly
                Hindu, but there are significant numbers of Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians among them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Malaysian Indian community has also assimilated and integrated aspects of the local Malaysian
                culture. Over time, they have embraced and contributed to the multicultural landscape of Malaysia. For
                instance, Malaysian Indians enjoy traditional Malaysian foods, participate in local festivals, and often
                wear traditional Malay attire during cultural events. However, they continue to celebrate their own
                festivals and maintain their cultural practices. Prominent Indian festivals celebrated in Malaysia
                include Deepavali (the Festival of Lights), Thaipusam, Pongal, and Navratri. These festivals feature
                traditional music, dance, and rituals that reflect Indian cultural heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Indian classical dance forms such as Bharatanatyam and Kathak are performed during cultural events and
                festivals, while Bollywood music and films have a strong following. Literature and folklore from India,
                such as the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, hold a special place in the cultural life of Malaysian
                Indians. Traditional Indian art, crafts, and cuisine, including dosa, idli, and biryani, continue to be
                cherished aspects of their cultural identity in Malaysia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the blending of cultures, the Malaysian Indian community remains deeply connected to their
                roots, celebrating their heritage with pride while contributing to Malaysia’s vibrant multicultural
                society

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Based on the 2000 Malaysian Census, the Indian community in Malaysia practices a diverse range of
                    religions. Hinduism is the predominant religion among Malaysian Indians, with significant numbers
                    also adhering to Islam, Christianity, and Sikhism. Hindu temples are commonly found throughout
                    Malaysia, particularly in areas with large Indian communities, and serve as important centers for
                    religious and cultural activities. Key Hindu festivals such as Deepavali (Diwali) and Thaipusam are
                    widely celebrated with vibrant processions and rituals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In addition to Hinduism, Islam is practiced by a substantial number of Malaysian Indians,
                    particularly among the Indian Muslim community known as "Mamas" or "Mamas" (descendants of Indian
                    Muslim immigrants). Mosques are prevalent in areas with significant Indian Muslim populations, and
                    Islamic festivals such as Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are observed with communal prayers and feasts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Christianity is another significant religion among Malaysian Indians, with a number of churches
                    serving this community. Indian Christians celebrate festivals such as Christmas and Easter, and
                    church activities often include community outreach and social services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sikhism is practiced by a smaller segment of the Indian community, with gurdwaras (Sikh temples)
                    serving as places of worship and community gathering. Key Sikh festivals like Vaisakhi are
                    celebrated with community events and religious ceremonies.

                <li>
                    In the realm of education, Malaysian Indians have established a robust system of educational
                    institutions that cater to their community's needs. Historically, Indian immigrants established
                    their own schools to preserve their cultural and linguistic heritage. Today, these schools continue
                    to provide education in Tamil and other Indian languages, alongside the national curriculum.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Tamil-language primary and secondary schools in Malaysia are categorized into two main types:
                    government-aided and private schools. Government-aided schools (SJKT) receive financial support from
                    the government, which helps cover operational costs and maintain infrastructure. These schools are
                    known for their focus on Tamil language and culture while integrating national education standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Private Tamil schools, on the other hand, operate independently of government funding and rely on
                    school fees and donations from the Indian community to sustain their operations. Despite the lack of
                    government funding, these schools are committed to providing quality education and preserving Tamil
                    culture and language.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, there are also institutions of higher learning, including colleges and universities,
                    which offer courses in Tamil language, Indian history, and other related subjects. These
                    institutions play a crucial role in advancing educational opportunities for Malaysian Indians and
                    maintaining their cultural identity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overall, the Indian community in Malaysia has made significant contributions to the educational
                    landscape, ensuring that their cultural heritage is preserved while also integrating into the
                    broader Malaysian society.
